Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This project employs machine learning, specifically Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and CatBoost, to enhance credit card fraud detection. Utilizing a large dataset of authentic and fraudulent transactions,
the models analyse variables such as location, time, date, and user behaviour, improving accuracy in identifying potential threats. Logistic Regression evaluates data relationships, while XGBoost and
CatBoost optimize machine-learning models for efficient fraud detection.
